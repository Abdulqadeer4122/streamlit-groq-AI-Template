# streamlit-groq-AI-Template

This project demonstrates how to build a simple UI using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and interact with Groq-powered language models through [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).

It includes a basic `main.py` file showing how to integrate these tools to quickly prototype LLM applications with a clean user interface.
